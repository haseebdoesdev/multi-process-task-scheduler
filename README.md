# Multi-Process Task Scheduler with Priority Management

A priority-based task scheduler that orchestrates multiple worker processes and their internal thread pools to execute heterogeneous tasks concurrently. This project demonstrates core Operating Systems concepts including process management, inter-process communication (IPC), threading, and synchronization.

## Overview

The system consists of:
- **Main Scheduler**: Parent process that manages a shared task queue and coordinates worker processes
- **Worker Processes**: Multiple worker processes that continuously poll the queue and execute tasks using threads
- **Shared Memory**: Centralized task queue accessible by all processes with proper synchronization
- **Shell Interface**: Operator-friendly scripts for task management and monitoring

## Features

- Priority-based task scheduling (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Multiple worker processes with thread-based execution
- Shared memory IPC with mutex and condition variable synchronization
- **🌐 Beautiful Web Dashboard** with real-time updates and animated charts
- Terminal-based real-time monitoring
- CSV report generation
- Graceful shutdown and resource cleanup

## Requirements

- Linux environment (tested on Ubuntu/Debian)
- GCC compiler
- POSIX-compliant system with support for:
  - System V IPC (shared memory, message queues)
  - POSIX threads (pthreads)
  - Named pipes (FIFOs)

## Building

1. Clone or extract the project:
```bash
cd os-project
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
make
```

This will compile all source files and create the `scheduler` and `worker` executables.

3. Make scripts executable (if needed):
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

## Usage

### Starting the Scheduler

```bash
./scripts/start_scheduler.sh
```

This will:
- Build the project if needed
- Clean up any existing shared memory
- Start the scheduler process
- Spawn worker processes

The scheduler will run in the background. Logs are written to the `logs/` directory.

### Adding Tasks

```bash
./scripts/add_task.sh <name> <priority> <duration_ms>
```

**Parameters:**
- `name`: Task name (use quotes if it contains spaces)
- `priority`: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
- `duration_ms`: Execution time in milliseconds

**Examples:**
```bash
./scripts/add_task.sh "Data Processing" HIGH 5000
./scripts/add_task.sh "Backup Task" MEDIUM 10000
./scripts/add_task.sh "Low Priority Task" LOW 2000
```

### Web Dashboard (Recommended)

Access the beautiful real-time web dashboard:
```bash
./scripts/start_web_dashboard.sh
```

Then open your browser and visit: **http://localhost:8080**

**Features:**
- 🎨 Modern, animated dashboard interface
- 📊 Real-time graphs and charts (throughput, status distribution)
- 📈 Live task queue with progress bars
- ⚡ Auto-refreshing statistics
- 🎯 Interactive filtering and sorting
- 📱 Responsive design (works on mobile/tablet)

The dashboard updates every 2 seconds automatically. Stop it with:
```bash
./scripts/stop_web_dashboard.sh
```

### Terminal Monitoring

Monitor the system in the terminal:
```bash
./scripts/monitor.sh
```

This displays:
- Total/completed/failed task counts
- Active worker count
- Current queue status
- All tasks with their status

Press Ctrl+C to exit monitoring.

### Generating Reports

Generate a CSV report of all tasks:
```bash
./scripts/report.sh [output_file.csv]
```

If no output file is specified, a timestamped file will be created.

**Report Format:**
- task_id
- name
- priority
- status
- creation_time
- start_time
- end_time
- duration_ms
- worker_id

### Cleanup

Stop the scheduler and clean up all resources:
```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```

This will:
- Kill the scheduler and all worker processes
- Remove shared memory segments
- Clean up temporary files

## Configuration

Edit `config.h` to customize:

- `MAX_TASKS`: Maximum number of tasks in queue (default: 100)
- `NUM_WORKERS`: Number of worker processes (default: 3)
- `MAX_THREADS_PER_WORKER`: Thread pool size per worker (default: 4)
- `SHM_KEY`, `SEM_KEY`, `MSG_KEY`: IPC keys
- `LOG_DIR`: Logging directory (default: "logs")

After changing configuration, rebuild:
```bash
make clean && make
```

## Architecture Details

### Task Queue

Tasks are stored in a priority queue in shared memory. The queue maintains:
- Priority ordering (HIGH=0, MEDIUM=1, LOW=2)
- Task lifecycle tracking (PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED)
- Global statistics (total, completed, failed tasks)

### Synchronization

- **Mutex**: Protects queue operations (enqueue/dequeue, status updates)
- **Condition Variable**: Signals workers when tasks become available
- **Process-shared attributes**: Mutex and condition variable are shared across processes

### Worker Process Model

- Workers run continuously in a pool
- Each worker polls the queue for tasks
- Tasks are executed in separate threads within the worker
- Worker processes are monitored and respawned if they crash

### Logging

All processes log to separate files in the `logs/` directory:
- `scheduler_<pid>.log`: Scheduler logs
- `worker_<id>_<pid>.log`: Worker logs

Log format: `[TIMESTAMP] [PID] [LEVEL] message`

## Example Workflow

1. Start the scheduler:
```bash
./scripts/start_scheduler.sh
```

2. Add several tasks:
```bash
./scripts/add_task.sh "Task 1" HIGH 3000
./scripts/add_task.sh "Task 2" LOW 5000
./scripts/add_task.sh "Task 3" HIGH 2000
./scripts/add_task.sh "Task 4" MEDIUM 4000
```

3. Start the web dashboard (in a new terminal):
```bash
./scripts/start_web_dashboard.sh
```
Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

Or monitor in terminal:
```bash
./scripts/monitor.sh
```

4. Generate a report:
```bash
./scripts/report.sh my_report.csv
```

5. Clean up:
```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Scheduler won't start
- Check if shared memory already exists: `ipcs -m`
- Run cleanup script: `./scripts/cleanup.sh`
- Check logs in `logs/` directory

### Tasks not executing
- Verify workers are running: `ps aux | grep worker`
- Check worker logs in `logs/` directory
- Ensure shared memory is accessible

### Permission errors
- Ensure scripts are executable: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
- Check write permissions for `logs/` directory

### Shared memory issues
- Run cleanup: `./scripts/cleanup.sh`
- Check system limits: `ipcs -l`
- Manually remove: `ipcrm -m <shmid>`
